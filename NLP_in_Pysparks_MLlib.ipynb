    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a very trendy topic in the data science area today that is really handy for tasks like **chat bots**, movie or **product review analysis** and especially **tweet classification**. In this notebook, we will cover the **classification aspect of NLP** and go over the features that Spark has for cleaning and preparing your data for analysis. We will also touch on how to implement **ML Pipelines** to a few of our data processing steps to help make our code run a bit faster. "
