    "Indeed.com has just hired you to create a system that automatically flags suspicious job postings on it's website. It has recently seen an influx of fake job postings that is negativley impacting it's customer experience. Becuase of the high volume of job postings it receives everyday, their employees don't have the capacity to check every posting so they would like an automated system that prioritizes which postings to review before deleting it. \n",
